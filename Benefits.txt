Benefits for Underdeveloped Countries
Resource Allocation

Governments can allocate resources more effectively by identifying factors that contribute most to accident severity. This helps prioritize improvements in specific areas, such as road infrastructure or safety measures.
Policy Planning

Policymakers can use the model to inform and implement targeted policies aimed at reducing accident severity, based on identified risk factors.
Preventive Measures

The model can be used to proactively implement preventive measures in high-risk areas, such as speed limit enforcement, signage improvement, or targeted education campaigns.
Emergency Response Optimization

Emergency response services can benefit from predictions to optimize resource allocation and response times in areas with a higher likelihood of severe accidents.
